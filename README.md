## Overview

The JPMorgan Chase & Co. Cybersecurity Job Simulation provided a practical, immersive experience to build foundational cybersecurity skills by working through real-world challenges. Over the course of April 2024, I completed four hands-on projects spanning fraud detection, application security, machine learning email classification, and access management. These projects strengthened my technical abilities and expanded my understanding of key cybersecurity principles.

## Projects Summary

### 1. Financial Fraud Detection Analysis  
- Analyzed a large dataset of mobile money transactions to identify fraudulent patterns and flagged activities.  
- Explored transaction types and evaluated automated fraud detection performance.  
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Skills:** Data analysis, visualization, anomaly detection, risk assessment  

### 2. Application Security Fundamentals  
- Studied core cybersecurity principles including authentication mechanisms like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and One-Time Passwords (OTP).  
- Learned about common web vulnerabilities based on OWASP Top 10 guidelines and mitigation strategies.  
- **Technologies:** Python, Django (conceptual study)  
- **Skills:** Secure coding principles, authentication best practices, threat awareness  

### 3. Machine Learning Email Classifier  
- Built a Business Email Compromise (BEC) detection system using machine learning to classify spam versus legitimate emails.  
- Processed and extracted features from email data such as content, headers, and attachments.  
- Trained and evaluated models using logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.  
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- **Skills:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification modeling, performance evaluation  

### 4. User Access Management System  
- Designed a role management system enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege by limiting active roles per user.  
- Implemented caching and automation logic to manage role assignments and removals efficiently.  
- Analyzed time and space complexity of the system’s operations.  
- **Technologies:** Python, Data Structures (dictionaries, lists)  
- **Skills:** Access control, role-based access management, algorithmic thinking, security governance
