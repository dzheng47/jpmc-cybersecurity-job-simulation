## Overview

This virtual job simulation offered a hands-on introduction to cybersecurity fundamentals through four structured tasks. Each task simulated a real-world problem faced by professionals in the field ‚Äî ranging from fraud detection to access management. Deliverables included code, written analysis, and conceptual design.

All tasks were completed in April 2024 using Python, Jupyter notebooks, and various data science tools. Tasks 1, 3, and 4 include working code files. Task 2 was research-based only, without coding deliverables.
